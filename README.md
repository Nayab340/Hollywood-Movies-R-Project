Hollywood Movies - R Project 

In this Project I had to do the following:

1. Import Dataset
2. Import Library
3. Check Data Types
4. Check for Missing Values
5. Dropping the missing values
6. Checking for duplicates and removing them
7. Rounding off values to 2 d.p
8. Checking for outliers using a boxplot
     -Remove outliers in "Profitability"
     -Remove the outliers in 'Worldwide.Gross'
9. Do a Summary Statistics/Univariate Analysis using appropriate code
      -bivariate analysis
10. Write a line of code to export the clean data

**After cleanind the data in R I had to create a dashboard on Powerbi **

In your Power BI Dashboard, the task was to create graphs for the following:
(The colour scheme was limited to blue, green and brown)

The average Rotten Tomatoes ratings of each genre
The number of movies produced per year 
The audience score for each film  
The profitability per studio 
The worldwide gross per genre 

Here is the dashboard link for PowerBi:
